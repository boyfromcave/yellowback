# DigiDollar BIP9 Activation — Complete Explainer

## Post-activation status (v9.26.5): BURIED DEPLOYMENT

**DigiDollar activated, and the deployment is now buried.** As of v9.26.5 the Taproot, DigiDollar, and AlgoLock deployments are **buried deployments** (BIP90): activation is a hardcoded per-network height (`Consensus::Params::DeploymentHeight()`, fields `TaprootHeight` / `DigiDollarHeight` / `AlgoLockHeight` in `src/consensus/params.h`), not a live BIP9 state machine. The burial heights are the empirically verified BIP9 `since` heights — testnet26 verified block-by-block, mainnet verified against live `getdeploymentinfo`:

| Network | `TaprootHeight` | `DigiDollarHeight` | `AlgoLockHeight` |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Mainnet | 21,168,000 | 23,869,440 | 23,869,440 |
| Testnet (testnet26) | 0 | 600 | 0 |
| Signet / Regtest | 0 | 0 | 0 |

The static gates keep their historical floors: mainnet `nDDActivationHeight = nOracleActivationHeight = nDigiDollarMuSig2Height = 23,627,520` (below the 23,869,440 burial height — `EarliestActivationFloor = min(nDDActivationHeight, DigiDollarHeight)` preserves the 23,627,520 prune/collateral floor exactly); testnet 600; default regtest DD/oracle gates 650 with `nDigiDollarMuSig2Height = min(650, DigiDollarHeight) = 0`.

**What changed operationally in v9.26.5:**

- **No signaling.** Blocks no longer set bits 2/23/0; the STARTED/LOCKED_IN/FAILED states no longer exist for these three deployments. `getblocktemplate` lists `taproot`/`digidollar`/`algolock` in `rules` when active (hardcoded like `csv`), omits them from `vbavailable`, and never sets their bits in the template `version`.
- **RPC shapes.** `getdeploymentinfo`/`getblockchaininfo` render the three as `{"type":"buried","active":bool,"height":N}` with no `bip9` sub-object. `getdigidollardeploymentinfo` now returns `{enabled, type:"buried", status:"active"|"defined", activation_height (omitted if disabled), oracle_activation_height, musig2_format_activation_height, oracle_pubkey_count, oracle_consensus_required, oracle_total_slots, oracle_seed_peers, musig2_session{...}}` — the BIP9 fields (`bit`, `start_time`, `timeout`, `min_activation_height`, signaling statistics) were removed and `activation_height` is always the burial height.
- **Regtest knobs.** `-digidollaractivationheight=N` sets `DigiDollarHeight` and the static DD/oracle/MuSig2 gates to N, so DigiDollar activates at exactly height N (pre-burial it ran real BIP9 signaling and activated at the first 144-block window boundary >= max(432, N)). New `-testactivationheight=taproot@H` / `digidollar@H` / `algolock@H` moves only the buried deployment height; `-digidollaractivationheight` takes precedence for DigiDollar. `-vbparams=digidollar/taproot/algolock` is now a startup error ("Invalid deployment") — only `testdummy` remains a versionbits deployment.
- **Predicates.** `IsDigiDollarEnabled` is a pure height compare against `DigiDollarHeight`; no `VersionBitsCache` exists anywhere in the DigiDollar path. `MinBIP9WarningHeight` moved to 23,909,760 (mainnet) / 800 (testnet) so the historical signaling periods do not trigger "unknown new rules" warnings.

> **The rest of this document is a historical record.** It describes the BIP9 mechanism as designed and as it actually ran through activation — verified block-by-block on testnet26 (DEFINED 0–199, STARTED 200–399, LOCKED_IN 400–599, ACTIVE at 600) and via live mainnet `getdeploymentinfo` (DigiDollar locked in and activated at block 23,869,440, six windows above the 23,627,520 floor). It is deliberately preserved because it documents how activation actually happened; it is **not** how current software evaluates activation.

## Overview

DigiDollar activated on the DigiByte blockchain through **BIP9 version bit signaling** — the same proven mechanism used by Bitcoin for SegWit and other soft forks. This ensured DigiDollar only activated once a supermajority of miners explicitly signaled support, preventing chain splits and ensuring network consensus. (As of v9.26.5 the completed deployment is buried; see the section above.)

**Key principle:** Nothing consensus-critical for DigiDollar works until activation. DD/oracle RPCs, DD transactions, DD opcodes, oracle price relay, oracle consensus relay, MuSig2 relay, `getoracles`, and signed oracle version heartbeats are dormant until the activation predicates below pass.

## BIP9 State Machine (historical — this is how activation actually ran)

DigiDollar followed the standard BIP9 state transitions:

```
DEFINED ──→ STARTED ──→ LOCKED_IN ──→ ACTIVE
   │            │
   │            └──→ FAILED (if timeout reached)
   └──→ FAILED (if timeout reached before start)
```

### Phase 1: DEFINED (blocks 0–199 on testnet)
- **What happens:** Nothing. DigiDollar deployment exists in the code but signaling hasn't begun.
- **Miner behavior:** Miners don't need to do anything. Block versions don't include bit 23.
- **User experience:** DigiDollar tab visible in Qt but shows "DigiDollar is not yet active on this blockchain" with current BIP9 status.
- **RPC behavior:** DD price/position/transaction/oracle-operation RPCs return error: "DigiDollar is not yet active on this blockchain". Local wallet oracle key-management RPCs (`createoraclekey`, `exportoracleprivkey`, `importoracleprivkey`) remain available so operators can prepare or recover keys before activation.
- **P2P behavior:** Oracle price/bundle/consensus/attestation/MuSig2 nonce/context/partial-sig/getoracles messages, including signed `oraclehb` heartbeats, are silently dropped until `IsOracleP2PActive` returns true.
- **Consensus:** DD transactions rejected with "digidollar-not-active". DD opcodes are not dispatched with DigiDollar semantics until `SCRIPT_VERIFY_DIGIDOLLAR` is set.

### Phase 2: STARTED (blocks 200–399 on testnet)
- **What happens:** Miners can now signal support by setting bit 23 in their block version.
- **Miner behavior:** `getblocktemplate` automatically includes bit 23 in the version field because `gbt_force=true`. Any miner using GBT (including cpuminer) signals automatically — no configuration needed.
- **Signaling check:** `getdeploymentinfo` RPC shows signal count and progress toward threshold.
- **User experience:** Same as DEFINED — everything still blocked. Qt overlay shows "STARTED" status.
- **Threshold:** 140 of 200 blocks in the window must signal bit 23 (70%).

### Phase 3: LOCKED_IN (blocks 400–599 on testnet)
- **What happens:** Threshold reached! Activation is guaranteed but delayed until `min_activation_height`.
- **Miner behavior:** Bit 23 is forced into block versions (`nVersion |= Mask`). All blocks signal.
- **User experience:** Still blocked. Qt overlay shows "LOCKED_IN" status. Users know activation is imminent.
- **Why the delay:** `min_activation_height` ensures all nodes have time to upgrade before DD transactions become valid.

### Phase 4: ACTIVE (block 600+ on testnet)
- **What happens:** DigiDollar is fully operational. MuSig2 oracle bundles are required in DD mint/redeem blocks; DD transfer-only and ordinary DGB blocks can omit the coinbase oracle bundle.
- **RPC behavior:** DD/oracle RPCs become functional (18 base in `src/rpc/digidollar.cpp`, 17 wallet-context in `src/wallet/rpc/wallet.cpp`).
- **P2P behavior:** Oracle messages (`oracleprice`, `oracleconsns`, `oracleattest`, `oramusnonce`, `oramusigctx`, `oramusigpsig`, `oraclehb`, `getoracles`) are processed, relayed, and validated according to the table below. Legacy `oraclebundle` messages are accepted on-wire but explicitly dropped — V1 carries the bundle on-chain in the coinbase, not via the bundle gossip message.
- **Consensus:** DD transactions are validated. DD opcodes are enforced via `SCRIPT_VERIFY_DIGIDOLLAR` (set in script flags when `DeploymentActiveAt(DEPLOYMENT_DIGIDOLLAR)` returns true).
- **Qt behavior:** Activation overlay disappears. Full DD tab (overview, send, receive, mint, redeem, positions, transactions) becomes accessible.
- **Oracle behavior:** Authorized oracle operators (slots 0-34 in `consensus.vOraclePublicKeys`, mainnet/testnet) can start their daemon, broadcast off-chain attestations and version heartbeats, participate in MuSig2 nonce/context/partial-sig rounds, and aggregate into the v0x03 on-chain bundle that miners embed in the coinbase for price-dependent DD blocks. `nDigiDollarMuSig2Height` is aligned with the effective DigiDollar activation boundary — MuSig2 v0x03 is the only accepted on-chain format from the moment DigiDollar/oracle consensus activates.

> **Activation boundary nuance (1-block off-by-one — historical, pre-burial).** This nuance applied while the deployment was a live BIP9 deployment; post-burial (v9.26.5) `getdeploymentinfo` has no `bip9` view for DigiDollar, and both the deployment predicate and `IsOracleActive` are pure height compares (the first active block is the burial height itself). Historically: `getdeploymentinfo` exposed a BIP9 view (`bip9.status = active`) that flips at the period boundary block — i.e. the block whose `pindexPrev->nHeight + 1 == min_activation_height`. The height-based gate `Consensus::IsOracleActive(params, height) == (height >= nOracleActivationHeight)` flips one block later, at `height == min_activation_height` itself. There is therefore a single-block window where `bip9.status` reports `active` but `IsOracleActive(tip)` is still `false`. This is harmless on production because `IsDigiDollarEnabled(prev_block)` already returns true at the period boundary and the miner refuses price-dependent DD mint/redeem templates without a valid v0x03 bundle. DD transfer-only blocks do not need a block oracle price. Boundary tests should use the height-based predicate (`IsOracleActive`/`IsDigiDollarEnabled`) rather than `getdeploymentinfo.bip9.status` when they need the consensus-rule moment, and Wave 12's `DD-FA-SEC-010` fix in `SpendsDigiDollarCollateralVault` deliberately uses `min(nDDActivationHeight, BIP9 min_activation_height)` for the same reason.

> **Regtest activation knobs (current, v9.26.5).** The direct `-digidollaractivationheight=N` regtest knob (`src/chainparams.cpp`) retargets the buried `DigiDollarHeight` together with the static DD/oracle/MuSig2 height gates (`nDDActivationHeight` / `nOracleActivationHeight` / `nDigiDollarMuSig2Height`) in `src/kernel/chainparams.cpp`, so DigiDollar activates at exactly height N. `-testactivationheight=digidollar@H` moves only the buried deployment height (static gates keep their defaults; `-digidollaractivationheight` takes precedence), which lets tests decouple the deployment boundary from the static 650 DD/oracle P2P gates in either direction. `-vbparams=digidollar:...` is now a startup error. Default regtest remains intentionally special: the buried `DigiDollarHeight` is `0`, while the DD/oracle P2P height gates default to `650` for local testing. `nDigiDollarMuSig2Height = min(650, DigiDollarHeight) = 0` so v0x03 quotes are valid whenever DigiDollar is active. Startup oracle-price reconstruction follows the buried predicate used by block connection, so DD-active default-regtest blocks below 650 are not skipped during restart/reindex cache rebuilds.

## What Gets Gated (Complete List)

### RPC Commands

The DigiDollar/oracle RPC surface is split between the node-context registration in `src/rpc/digidollar.cpp` (registered via `RegisterDigiDollarRPCCommands`) and the wallet-context registration in `src/wallet/rpc/wallet.cpp` (added inside `GetWalletRPCCommands`).

**Node-context (18, registered in `src/rpc/digidollar.cpp:6266`):**
- `getdigidollarstats`, `getdcamultiplier`, `calculatecollateralrequirement`, `getdigidollardeploymentinfo`, `importdigidollaraddress`, `estimatecollateral`
- `getoracleprice`, `getalloracleprices`, `getprotectionstatus`, `getoracles`, `getoraclesigners`, `listoracle`, `stoporacle`, `getoraclepubkey`
- Regtest helpers: `setmockoracleprice`, `getmockoracleprice`, `simulatepricevolatility`, `enablemockoracle`

**Wallet-context (17, added in `src/wallet/rpc/wallet.cpp:888`):**
`mintdigidollar`, `senddigidollar`, `sendmanydigidollar`, `redeemdigidollar`, `listdigidollarpositions`, `listdigidollaraddresses`, `getredemptioninfo`, `getdigidollarbalance`, `getdigidollaraddress`, `listdigidollartxs`, `listdigidollarunspent`, `listdigidollarutxos`, `validateddaddress`, `createoraclekey`, `exportoracleprivkey`, `importoracleprivkey`, `startoracle`.

`createoraclekey`, `exportoracleprivkey`, and `importoracleprivkey` are not activation-gated because they only manage wallet-local oracle signing keys. They do not start an oracle or publish prices. `startoracle` remains activation-gated.

**Removed / never present:** `sendoracleprice` was deleted as a fake-price-injection vulnerability; `submitoracleprice` does not exist anywhere in the source tree. Oracle prices come exclusively from live exchange aggregation aggregated under MuSig2. `src/rpc/digidollar_transactions.cpp` declares `getdigidollarinfo`, `transferdigidollar`, `createrawddtransaction`, and `listredeemablepositions`, but the file is **not registered** anywhere — treat it as legacy/unused.

**Gate pattern:** DD price/position/transaction/oracle-operation RPCs call `DigiDollar::IsDigiDollarEnabled(tip, chainman)` near the top of their handler. That helper checks the buried `DEPLOYMENT_DIGIDOLLAR` activation height via `DeploymentActiveAfter()` (BIP90 since v9.26.5). Local wallet key-management RPCs (`createoraclekey`, `exportoracleprivkey`, `importoracleprivkey`) and the deployment-status probe are intentionally usable before activation.

### P2P Message Handlers

`src/protocol.cpp` defines the on-wire command names; `src/net_processing.cpp` handles each one. Price, consensus, MuSig2, and `getoracles` handlers bail out early when `Consensus::IsOracleActive(params, height)` is false.

| Wire command (`src/protocol.cpp`) | C++ constant | Handler in `src/net_processing.cpp` | Notes |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|-------|
| `oracleprice` | `NetMsgType::ORACLEPRICE` | line 5452 | Off-chain oracle attestation (input to MuSig2) |
| `oraclebundle` | `NetMsgType::ORACLEBUNDLE` | line 5619 | **Accepted on the wire but always dropped** — V1 puts the bundle on-chain in the coinbase, not via gossip |
| `oracleconsns` | `NetMsgType::ORACLECONSENSUS` | line 5636 | Off-chain consensus proposal driving MuSig2 |
| `oracleattest` | `NetMsgType::ORACLEATTESTATION` | line 5755 | Per-oracle attestation supporting a consensus proposal |
| `oramusnonce` | `NetMsgType::ORACLEMUSIGNONCE` | line 5859 | MuSig2 round-1 public nonces |
| `oramusigctx` | `NetMsgType::ORACLEMUSIGCONTEXT` | line 5971 | MuSig2 context proposal fixing participant/nonce/quote set before partial signatures |
| `oramusigpsig` | `NetMsgType::ORACLEMUSIGPARTIALSIG` | line 6064 | MuSig2 round-2 partial signatures bound to a session context |
| `oraclehb` | `NetMsgType::ORACLEHEARTBEAT` | line 6175 | Signed oracle software/protocol heartbeat; telemetry, not a price input |
| `getoracles` | `NetMsgType::GETORACLES` | line 6262 | Pull request for missing oracle messages; replies with fresh `oracleprice` messages and recent `oraclehb` heartbeats |

**Note:** The price/consensus/MuSig2/getoracles gates use `Consensus::IsOracleActive(params, ActiveChain().Height())`, which is `nHeight >= params.nOracleActivationHeight`. On mainnet and testnet `nOracleActivationHeight` equals `nDDActivationHeight` (the historical BIP9 floor — mainnet 23,627,520, below the 23,869,440 buried activation height); on default regtest the buried `DigiDollarHeight` is 0 while the P2P height gates default to 650. A peer sending gated oracle messages before the height gate is silently ignored — no ban, no misbehaviour penalty — just dropped at the start of each handler.

> **AUDIT NOTE:** As of the current code, `NetMsgType::ORACLEHEARTBEAT` uses `IsOracleP2PActive`, the same top-level activation helper used by the price, consensus, MuSig2, and `getoracles` handlers. It is also restricted to active consensus-roster oracle IDs, Schnorr-authenticated against chainparams, capped at 240 messages per peer per hour, deduplicated, and only returned by `getoracles` when recent.

> **Caveat (v9.26.5).** The height predicate `IsOracleActive` is independent of the buried deployment predicate (`IsDigiDollarEnabled`). On mainnet the static gates (23,627,520) sit below the buried activation height (23,869,440), and on default regtest the buried height (0) sits below the 650 P2P gates — in both cases `IsOracleP2PActive` requires BOTH predicates, so the oracle P2P surface only opens once the later of the two boundaries is passed. Use `IsOracleActive` and `IsDigiDollarEnabled` deliberately for boundary tests when the P2P moment and consensus-rule moment differ.

### Consensus Validation (all activation-gated)

1. **Mempool acceptance** (`src/validation.cpp:976-989`): `DigiDollar::HasDigiDollarMarker(tx)` + `IsDigiDollarEnabled()` → rejects DD TXs with `TX_CONSENSUS "digidollar-not-active"`. After activation, mempool acceptance also requires that an oracle quote is available for any DD transaction (commit `81bf974f40`).
2. **Block validation** (`src/validation.cpp:2816-2854`): `DeploymentActiveAt(DEPLOYMENT_DIGIDOLLAR)` during `ConnectBlock()` delegates to `DeploymentActiveAfter(index.pprev, ...)`, so the candidate block is judged by comparing the previous block's height + 1 against the buried activation height (v9.26.5). Blocks containing DD TXs before activation are rejected. After activation, `ValidateBlockOracleData` (`src/oracle/bundle_manager.cpp:2151`) requires DD mint/redeem blocks to carry exactly one v0x03 MuSig2 oracle bundle in the coinbase. DD transfer-only and non-DD blocks may omit oracle data; if any block includes one it must still be a valid v0x03 bundle (commit `1e08bd811f`).
3. **Script verification** (`validation.cpp` script-flag setup): `SCRIPT_VERIFY_DIGIDOLLAR` flag only set when `DeploymentActiveAt()` returns true, so the Tapscript OP_SUCCESSx-class DD opcodes are not interpreted as DigiDollar operations before activation. Once active, `OP_CHECKPRICE` is reserved and deterministically disabled (`src/script/interpreter.cpp:708-735`): it consumes one stack item and pushes false rather than reading node-local oracle state.
4. **Mining graceful degradation** (`src/node/miner.cpp`, commit `6b5ff516c3`): `CreateNewBlock` strips price-dependent DD mint/redeem txs when no valid oracle bundle is available rather than aborting block assembly. Transfer-only DD txs are validated with oracle-price validation skipped because they do not need a block oracle price. The block is still produced; rejected DD txs remain in the mempool until either they confirm in a later attempt or are evicted.

Historical validation, IBD, and reorg handling follow the same predicates. `ValidateBlockOracleData()` returns true before the historical activation state, startup price-cache reconstruction only loads blocks that pass the same activation predicate for their historical context, IBD/catch-up skips oracle-dependent DD validation where the code cannot safely re-evaluate old wall-clock freshness with current state, and `DisconnectBlock()` removes the connected block's price-cache entry during reorg.

### Qt GUI

- **DigiDollar tab:** Always visible, but shows activation status overlay (QStackedWidget) when DD inactive
- **Sub-widget polling:** All DD widgets check `isVisible()` before making RPC calls — prevents RPC queue flooding when DD tab is hidden behind overlay
- **Activation check timer:** Runs every 5 seconds, calls `DigiDollar::IsDigiDollarEnabled()`. Stops and reveals DD functionality once active.

## Miner Signaling — How It Works (historical)

Post-burial (v9.26.5) miners no longer signal: `ComputeBlockVersion` never sets bits 2/23/0, `getblocktemplate` advertises `taproot`/`digidollar`/`algolock` as plain `rules` entries when active, and `vbavailable` no longer mentions them. The description below is how signaling worked during the live BIP9 deployment.

### Why miners signaled automatically

The `VBDeploymentInfo` for DigiDollar has `gbt_force = true` (in `src/deploymentinfo.cpp`). This means:

1. During `STARTED` state, `getblocktemplate` includes bit 23 in `vbavailable`
2. Because `gbt_force=true`, the bit is NOT cleared even if the miner doesn't explicitly support "digidollar" in its GBT rules
3. The version field returned by `getblocktemplate` already has bit 23 set
4. cpuminer (and any GBT-based miner) uses this version directly → automatic signaling

### Block version format

```
Base version:  0x20000000 (BIP9 base)
+ Taproot bit: 0x00000004 (bit 2)
+ DD bit:      0x00800000 (bit 23)
= Combined:    0x20800004
```

During STARTED/LOCKED_IN, blocks should have version `0x20800004` or similar (with bit 23 set). Note: SegWit is a buried deployment in DigiByte (activated at a fixed height), not a version bits deployment, so it does not set any bit.

---

## Testing Activation

> **v9.26.5:** the BIP9 lifecycle/signaling test phases (state ladder, threshold math, timeout/FAILED) are unrepresentable post-burial and were replaced with buried-boundary equivalents; the tests keep their file names.

### Functional Tests

1. **`digidollar_activation.py`** — Tests the activation boundary:
   - Verifies DD RPCs fail before the buried activation height, work after
   - Tests DD minting, sending, redeeming after activation

2. **`digidollar_activation_boundary.py`** — Tests edge cases:
   - Exact activation-height boundary (off-by-one on either side)
   - Pre-activation DD rejection and reorg-below-activation behavior

### Manual Testing Checklist

Before activation (any block < 600):
- [ ] DD price/position/transaction/oracle-operation RPCs return "DigiDollar is not yet active on this blockchain"
- [ ] Local oracle key-management RPCs (`createoraclekey`, `exportoracleprivkey`, `importoracleprivkey`) remain usable for pre-activation operator setup/recovery
- [ ] `getdeploymentinfo` shows the `digidollar` entry as `{"type":"buried","active":false,"height":N}` (v9.26.5)
- [ ] Qt DD tab shows activation overlay
- [ ] No oracle messages processed (check debug.log; `IsOracleActive` returns false)
- [ ] DD transactions rejected from mempool with "digidollar-not-active"
- [ ] Block versions do NOT signal bit 23 (buried deployment — no signaling)

After activation (block 600+):
- [ ] DD RPCs functional
- [ ] Can mint DigiDollar (requires a valid MuSig2 oracle bundle in the mining template)
- [ ] Can send DigiDollar
- [ ] Can redeem DigiDollar
- [ ] Oracles can start (`createoraclekey` + `startoracle`) and broadcast attestations
- [ ] Oracle attestations, version heartbeats, and MuSig2 nonce/context/partial-sig messages propagate via P2P
- [ ] Qt DD tab shows full functionality
- [ ] `SCRIPT_VERIFY_DIGIDOLLAR` enabled in block script flags
- [ ] DD mint/redeem blocks include a v0x03 MuSig2 oracle bundle in the coinbase; DD transfer-only blocks can omit it (raw v0x01 / v0x02 wire payloads short-circuit inside `ExtractOracleBundle` and surface as `bad-oracle-malformed`; the `bad-oracle-legacy` branch is defense-in-depth and is not reached by current wire shapes)

---

## Mainnet Activation Timeline (historical — completed)

This is the process as it actually completed on mainnet. DigiDollar locked in and activated at block **23,869,440** (July 2026, six confirmation windows above the 23,627,520 floor), and the deployment was buried in v9.26.5. Historically, the process was:

1. **Release:** Publish binaries with DigiDollar code and BIP9 deployment
2. **Upgrade period:** Miners and nodes upgrade (BIP9 start time: June 1, 2026)
3. **Signaling begins:** After start time (June 1, 2026), miners signal bit 23 in blocks
4. **Threshold reached:** 70% of blocks in a 40,320-block window (~1 week) signal support
5. **Lock-in period:** One more 40,320-block window for remaining nodes to upgrade
6. **Activation:** Block height reaches `min_activation_height` (23,627,520) and BIP9 is ACTIVE
7. **DigiDollar live:** All DD functionality enabled across the network

**Timeout:** If 70% signaling had not been reached by June 1, 2027, the deployment would have transitioned to FAILED and a new deployment with different parameters would have been needed. This never happened — activation succeeded, and post-burial the FAILED state no longer exists for this deployment.

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Pre-activation protection:** All DD code paths are gated. A malicious node cannot trick other nodes into processing DD transactions or oracle messages before activation.

2. **No premature mining:** DD opcodes are not enforced as DigiDollar operations before activation. Even if someone crafts a transaction with DD opcodes, the DigiDollar semantics have no effect until `SCRIPT_VERIFY_DIGIDOLLAR` is set.

3. **Oracle P2P safety:** Price, consensus, MuSig2, `getoracles`, and signed `oraclehb` heartbeat messages received before `IsOracleP2PActive` are silently dropped (not banned).

4. **Consensus safety:** Mempool policy rejects DD-marker transactions before activation, but block consensus preserves base-chain compatibility: pre-activation DD-looking markers are treated as ordinary DGB data and DigiDollar semantics are not applied until the deployment is active (buried height since v9.26.5).

5. **BIP9 guarantees (historical):** The activation mechanism was the same one Bitcoin used for SegWit — battle-tested across multiple blockchains, providing clear upgrade coordination. Having served that purpose, the completed deployment is now buried (BIP90, v9.26.5), exactly as Bitcoin buried CSV and SegWit after their activations.

## Mainnet `nOracleActivationHeight` and `nDDActivationHeight`

Both heights are intentionally aligned in `src/kernel/chainparams.cpp`:

| Network | `nDDActivationHeight` | `nOracleActivationHeight` | `nDigiDollarMuSig2Height` |
|---------|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Mainnet | `23627520` | `consensus.nDDActivationHeight` (i.e. `23627520`) | `consensus.nDDActivationHeight` (i.e. `23627520`) |
| Testnet26 | `600` | `600` | `600` |
| Regtest | `650` | `650` | `0` |

A practical implication: there is no period in which the oracle P2P surface is live but DD itself is not (the P2P gate requires both `IsOracleActive` and `IsDigiDollarEnabled`), and there is no period in which DD is active but MuSig2 v0x03 is not yet the on-chain bundle format. On default regtest MuSig2 follows the buried `DigiDollarHeight` boundary (`0`) while DD/oracle height gates remain at 650 for local testing. Documents that say "mainnet `nOracleActivationHeight = 3000000`" are stale; that earlier staging configuration was removed before V1 launch.

> **v9.26.5 burial note.** These three static gates keep the 23,627,520 mainnet floor even though the deployment is buried at its actual activation height 23,869,440. The floor is what drives `EarliestActivationFloor = min(nDDActivationHeight, DigiDollarHeight)` (prune lock, pre-floor coin gate), while the buried `DigiDollarHeight` is what gates DD consensus/RPC/mempool/script. On mainnet the actual single activation event was block 23,869,440.

| P2P activation gate | `src/net_processing.cpp` | `IsOracleP2PActive()` in `ORACLEPRICE`/`ORACLEBUNDLE`/`ORACLECONSENSUS`/`ORACLEATTESTATION`/`ORACLEMUSIGNONCE`/`ORACLEMUSIGCONTEXT`/`ORACLEMUSIGPARTIALSIG`/`GETORACLES`/`ORACLEHEARTBEAT` |
| Mempool gate | `src/validation.cpp:976-989` | `IsDigiDollarEnabled()` in `AcceptToMemoryPool`; recent MuSig2 quote required for DD txs |
| Block validation gate | `src/validation.cpp:2816-2854` | `DeploymentActiveAt(DEPLOYMENT_DIGIDOLLAR)` in `ConnectBlock` |
| Script flags | `src/validation.cpp:2755-2798` | `SCRIPT_VERIFY_DIGIDOLLAR` flag (set in `GetBlockScriptFlags`) |
| Qt activation overlay | `src/qt/digidollartab.cpp` | `checkActivationStatus()` timer |
| Qt widget polling guard | `src/qt/digidollar*widget.cpp` | `if (!isVisible()) return;` |
| Oracle height gate | `src/consensus/params.h:243-245` | `IsOracleActive()` |
| DD enabled check | `src/digidollar/digidollar.cpp` | `IsDigiDollarEnabled()` |
| Oracle bundle V1 enforcement | `src/oracle/bundle_manager.cpp` (`ValidateBlockOracleData`, `ExtractOracleBundle`, `CreateOracleScript`) | Raw v0x01/v0x02 OP_RETURN payloads short-circuit in `ExtractOracleBundle` (returns false), surfaced by the validator as `bad-oracle-malformed`. Only v0x03 MuSig2 bundles are accepted; the `bad-oracle-legacy` branch is defense-in-depth |
| Reserved `OP_CHECKPRICE` behavior | `src/script/interpreter.cpp:708-735` | `OP_CHECKPRICE` is reserved and deterministically disabled; the old `g_get_oracle_consensus_price` hook remains only for tests |
